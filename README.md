## 2 Questions
1. Is there one area of the city that contains the majority of the motor vehicle incidents? What is the relationship between vehicle type involved in an accident and the number of those injured?

    Graph 2: No, they are all spread evenly throughout all of the boroughs of New York City. There is not one particular     area that stands out. There tend to be a large number of Sedans and station wagons that are involved in accidents        and produce the most injuries. The incidents involving Taxis seem to be mainly confined to Manhattan.



2. Are motor vehicle incidents more prone to occuring in certain months versus others? Are the amount of people injured in an incident correlated to the total number of accidents?

   Graph 1: September has had historically the highest number of crashes, followed by March and April. The sum of total     injuries per month positively correlated with the total number of crashes per month, as September and March had the      most amount of people injured. The sum of people killed in motor vehicle incidents does not seem to be related, as       someone dying in a car accident is rare compared to injuries.
