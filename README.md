## Description of Data Set




## Questions

### Question 1

Question: Is there one area of the city that contains the majority of motor vehicle incidents? What is the relationship between the vehicle type involved in an accident and the number of those injured? 

Importance:

The NYC motor vehicle accident dataset that we decided to utilize breaks down where each accident occurred, as well as which vehicle type was involved in the accident, both of which would be needed to thoroughly respond to this question. Car accidents are the leading cause of death in United States citizens under the age of 54, so any preventative measures should be taken to reduce the annual volume of car accidents. This question is important to consider because there may be factors in certain areas of the city, such as road conditions or construction, that are contributing to an increased number of accidents. If lawmakers could pinpoint a reason behind the increased number of accidents, steps could be taken to reduce the number of accidents in that particular area of the city. Vehicle type is also interesting to consider because if only certain types of vehicles, such as taxis or trucks, are involved in a large number of accidents, preventative legislation could be put in place to prevent as many accidents as possible moving forward. 



### Question 2

Question: 

Question: Are motor vehicle incidents more prone to occurring in certain months versus others? Are the amount of people injured in an incident correlated to the total number of accidents?

Importance:

As previously mentioned, car accidents are the leading cause of death in US citizens under the age of 54, so it is important for lawmakers to look for patterns in accident data and try to put in place preventative policies in any area possible. This question is interesting, as there may be seasonal factors that are influencing the number of accidents. It will be interesting to see if there is a pattern to see if most accidents take place in the winter when there might be turbulent weather conditions or if seasonal factors do not hold a large stake in this data. After that is determined, the severity of the accident should be measured in the different months as well, to see if seasonal factors play a part in how many people are injured/killed. It would also be interesting to see if a larger volume of accidents in a certain month automatically leads to a larger amount of people injured/killed. Once all of this information is determined and any patterns are detected, lawmakers can then work on decreasing seasonal patterns and reducing accident-causing factors that can be controlled.
