## Description of Data Set


## 2 Questions
1. Is there one area of the city that contains the majority of the motor vehicle incidents? What is the relationship between vehicle type involved in an accident and the number of those injured?

    Graph 2: No, they are all spread evenly throughout all of the boroughs of New York City. There is not one particular     area that stands out. There tend to be a large number of Sedans and station wagons that are involved in accidents        and produce the most injuries. The incidents involving Taxis seem to be mainly confined to Manhattan.
